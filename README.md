## About the project

This project is about the creation of a landing page for Trote Solidário, an initiative that seeks to encourage the integration between university freshmen and seniors through social actions. The landing page aims to disseminate information about the Solidarity Hazing and, in addition, the site also has a functional calculator to account for the verification of the teams against the food collected by them during the Solidarity Hazing. The calculator will help with organization and healthy competition between teams, further encouraging student participation in social action.

## Who is Uni-FACEF
